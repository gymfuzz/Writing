Sal stared straight across the room at the woman sitting on the coldpod. She had her head in her hands and was rubbing her forehead. 
She was trying to push out the fuzzy feeling of a recent awakening.
Sal knew she had just been awakened from cold storage because she still had the monitor stamps festooning her chest and belly. 
Sal knew she was a woman because she had her head thrown back and her elbows knees spread wide. 
As Sal stared at her, Sal became aware that her name was Maree, and that she had joined the crew just before they left Highlift Spacestation. 
Once Sal remembered that, Sal also remembered being just awakened as well. That explained the fuzzy feel in Sal's head as well.
